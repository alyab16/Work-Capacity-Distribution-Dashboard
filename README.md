# Work-Capacity-Distribution-PowerBI-Dashboard

I developed a Power BI dashboard for the finance team in a company, enhancing visibility into work capacity distribution across initiatives and quarters. The dashboard improved decision-making for workload distribution, identified overworked or underutilized company associates, and facilitated effective project management. This tool empowered the Finance team to independently use and update the dashboard, promoting data-driven decision-making and improved resource management.

**Note:** In adherence to the companyâ€™s privacy policies, the data files and the Power BI report are not provided in this repository. Furthermore, the data presented has been altered to ensure the actual values are not disclosed.
